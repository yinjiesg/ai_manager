Machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned
 

Deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create an “artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own
 

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. While both fall under the broad category of artificial intelligence, deep learning is what powers the most human-like artificial intelligence
