Machine learning uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned
 

Deep learning structures algorithms in layers to create an “artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own
 

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. While both fall under the broad category of artificial intelligence, deep learning is what powers the most human-like artificial intelligence

As you can see on the above image of three concentric circles, DL is a subset of ML, which is also a subset of AI.
Interesting?
So, AI is the all-encompassing concept that initially erupted, then followed by ML that thrived later, and lastly DL that is promising to escalate the advances of AI to another level.
